# Markdown-to-JSON

Takes an md file and generates the equivalent JSON. The sample input and output could be compared using the `test.md` and the `test.json` added in the repo.

##Usage

The script could be run by supplying the path of the input file after the `-i` tag, the output file path after the `-o` tag followed by a topic string after the `-t` tag.

Example:

`python convert_md.py -i ./test.md -o ./test.json -t maths`
